Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

 a0-a7;a2

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

000000000000000e <f>:
g is inlined in f, not called

At what address is the function printf located?

628

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

38

Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);

What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian.
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

i would be 0x726c6400
57616 would be stored in register, not affected by endianness.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

depends on what old value is stored in the register. Because function retrives value from the registers. and we only feed one here.
